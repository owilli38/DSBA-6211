This repository shows both homework assigmnets, as well as my code from a group final project.
- My code for the Final Project uses open source Airbnb data from Sicily; first a did exploratory data analysis to clean and understand the data, as well as started joining the multiple dataframes together. I made a new target variable using Occupancy Rate, defining success as a measure of this when occupancy rate is greater than 70% during the year. The next part looked at a heat map for where/which neighborhoods had a greater proportion of "Successful" properties. Finally, I ended with a time series analysis of price to understand the breakdown in revenue between Successful and Unsuccessful properties in Sicily.
